# gFlickrUpload
When [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com) have got the great idea to let **1Tb** of free space to upload photos to the native resolution I think to upload all my photos, also only as backup *(the photos can be private)* I've decided to do my own uploader.

## How does it works?
Simply I've got all my photos into folders, and the name of the folder is the date and the description of the event.

with `gFlickrUploader` you choose the parent folder of the folder events.

The program loads the photos and the videos creating the set with the folder name *(if doesn't exists)*!

Here is the program!

You need to choose the folder where your folder/sets are stored and a folder where your photos uploaded will be moved *(:warning: `gFlickrUpload` only move the photos, no delete!)*.

you have the possibility to choose the privacy level of your photos: public, family and friends or private.

pressing the ![upload](http://ghiboz.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/appbar-cloud-upload.png?w=646) button the loading event starts, if you enable the pause, ends the current upload.
